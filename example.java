//The output will be option d as the code is correct but the problem is that it doesn't asks for any input from the user so all variables are blank. Hence the answer will be null 0 0 for string int and int respectively

class example {
int x; 
int y;
String name;
 
public static void main(String[] args)
 {
 example pnt = new example();
 System.out.println ("pnt is " + pnt.name + " " + pnt.x + " " + pnt.y);
}
}
